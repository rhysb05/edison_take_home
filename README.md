# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

You can search for books using the search bar. 
Each book that is returned to the list will take you to a google search of the title.
Each button will take you to a fun video, and spawn an annoying alert. 

Enter in as many searches as you'd like. Sometimes searching multiple times will crash the program.
Unable to figure out why exactly, in the time alloted. I believe it might be an unhandled error somewhere
in one of the .then() statements after the fetch.

I was unable to implement the mobile layout for the card component in a reasonable amount of time.

I mosty struggled with knowledge of syntax. The core concepts of React were understandable. Fun project.
